In a Json, Key is Always a String , so add this string `dob` in the end of a key 
for example if key is = "dateOfBirth" , 
then it will become "dateOfBirth`dob`"
so the output will become :
dob = 'dateOfBirth'

if it is a list then create changes to first object of the list

it does not matter if you have space after or before the `need` \ or this string is before or after key

add you whole json in input.txt file 

run the script , and you will find your desired replacer

when output comes, use find and replace to keep your desired dictionary name
